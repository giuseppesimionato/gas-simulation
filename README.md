# gas-simulation
simulate a gas/fluid confined in a sphere with Leonard-Jones interaction

## TODO:

- compute the lj potential and the total energy
- compute momenta
- tuning of parameters and unit of measure
- plot the energies
- plot the trajectoires (chose a particle, chose a timestep)

BONUS:
- make a gif of the simulation
- make a slicer for the dt
- make a slicer for the particle and plot position, velocity and acceleration of that particle

CONSIDERATIONS:
- if we use an high epsilon the partices will be trapped in a local minima and they will form particluar shapes
- pay attention to the timestep
